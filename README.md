# NYC-Taxi

==============================

Machine Learning project to predict trip duration for taxis in NYC

## Important

This code will give error until the project is installed as a package in the environment that has all the dependencies for the project.

After creation of environment and installation of all required packages using pip run this command in the command terminal.

```cmd
pip install -e .
```

| This will fix all the import statement errors such as `ModuleNotFoundError` when recreating pipelines using command

```cmd
dvc repro
```

## CI/CD through GitHub Acti ons

The CI/CD workflow will throw an error while creating the CML report because no Personal Access Token is linked to the repository for safety purposes.

I advice the user to generate his/her own access token and run this code in their own repository and it will work without any errors.

## Docker

Download Docker Desktop from the link [download here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

Once you are in project folder just type in the command

```cmd
docker init
```

The result will show something like this

> It is advised to check the DOCKERFILE before committing to the build image phase. You can check the DOCKERFILE in the project.

The next command to run is

```cmd
docker compose up --build
```
